In order to use the Twitter API Key to pull tweets from your Twitter into the theme, you’ll need to create a
Twitter Application through your account. It may seem super-technical, but it’s actually very simple to do.

1.- The first thing you need to do to get your Twitter API key is to create a Twitter Application.
Visit  apps.twitter.com and login to your Twitter account. 
Then just fill out the basic information for the application and it’s ready to be published.

2.- Now that you've created your application, Twitter has assigned you a few data points to work with.
Click on the tab "Key and Access Tokens", in there you will find the Consumer Key and the Consumer Secret.
You must create a personal Access Token and Secret Key to allow you to unlock personal account functions with your application
– just click Create Access Token and Twitter will add these data points as well.

(it´s important to have a Twitter acount to do this)
